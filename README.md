# Budget Tracker

## Description
    This showcases my knowledge in building off-line capabilities to an app, to create a PWA, or Progressive Web Application. Once you have loaded the app, if your connection isn't that great or if you lose connection or internet service, and data you saved to the budget tracker will be automatically loaded and saved once it comes back online.

  ## User Story
    GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
    WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
    THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
    WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
    THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated

  ## Technologies Used
    Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, JavaScript
